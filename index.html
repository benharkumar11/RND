        <h2>Definition of Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <p>It is a web development approach that ensures web pages look good and are usable on devices of all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Responsive Design Matters</h2>
        <p>Due to the growing variety of devices (smartphones, laptops, etc.) with different screen sizes and resolutions, there is a need to adapt to each device. This makes it easier for users to navigate and read content, which directly impacts user engagement and retention.</p>
        
        <h2>Explain the Use of the Viewport in Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <p>The viewport is crucial in responsive web design as it controls how a web page is displayed on different devices. Essentially, itâ€™s the visible area of a web page, and because mobile devices have smaller screens than desktops, websites need to adapt to these varying sizes to provide an optimal user experience.</p>
        
        <h2>What are Media Queries?</h2>
        <p>Media queries are a feature of CSS that enable the application of styles depending on the characteristics of the user's device, such as screen width, height, orientation, and resolution. Media queries are essential for creating responsive designs that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.</p>
        <p>Common Media Query Options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>max-width:</strong> Targets screens with a maximum width. Often used to apply styles when the screen size is below a certain width.</li>
            <li><strong>min-width:</strong> Targets screens with a minimum width. Useful to apply styles when the screen size is above a certain width.</li>
            <li><strong>orientation:</strong> Detects the orientation of the device. Can be portrait or landscape.</li>
            <li><strong>min-resolution and max-resolution:</strong> Detects the resolution of the device, useful for handling high-resolution displays.</li>
        </ul>
